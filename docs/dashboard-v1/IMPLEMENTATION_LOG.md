# Dashboard V1 — Implementation Log

Branch: `claude/dashboard-v1-foundation` (in `vigil-studios`). `main` untouched;
production deploys only from `main`.

---

## 2026-09-13 — Foundation built

### Decisions taken (see ARCHITECTURE.md §2 for the full table)

- Dashboard lives in `vigil-studios` under a second root layout `app/(vigil)`;
  the marketing site moved verbatim into `app/(site)` (URLs unchanged).
- `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` (Next 16 convention). The proxy only refreshes
  the session and redirects signed-out visitors; authorization is RLS plus the
  server DAL.
- Tenancy = `organizations` + `organization_members`; Vigil staff are a
  separate `staff_members` table. Active organization is a validated cookie.
- Provider identifiers live only in `provider_links`. Billing / deployment /
  domain providers are interfaces with in-memory `null` adapters and explicit
  not-configured stubs for Stripe, Vercel, Cloudflare. No SDKs added.
- Plans, prices, features and per-plan entitlements are rows. Four plan codes
  are seeded with **no prices**; every undecided limit is NULL.
- Requests, Leads, Virtue: tables + entitlement-gated routes only.
- Sign-in is a magic link. No self-serve organization creation; staff create
  the organization and invite the owner, and the invite auto-accepts on
  sign-in.
- The stale 12-day-old `next dev` process on port 3000 (PID 3246) was stopped
  so a fresh server could verify the route-group move; it served 404s for
  every new route.

### Migrations (`supabase/migrations/`)

### Validation results

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Migrations apply cleanly | `scripts/db-validate.sh` (PostgreSQL 14 + `supabase/test/auth-shim.sql`) | ✓ all 6 files |
| RLS / integrity assertions | `supabase/test/rls.test.sql` | ✓ 70 assertions (anon, two tenants, member vs owner, staff vs admin, service role, invites, last-owner, column protection, cross-tenant references, entitlement resolution, job claiming) |
| Unit tests | `npm test` (vitest) | ✓ 47 tests: lifecycle tables cover every enum, transitions, customer wording, entitlements, redirect safety, provider registry, null providers, job runner outcomes, slug/format helpers |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | ✓ |
| Lint (new code) | `npx eslint app lib/vigil components/vigil proxy.ts` | ✓ 0 errors, 0 warnings. Pre-existing marketing-section errors (9) untouched |
| Production build | `npx next build` | ✓ 25 static + dynamic routes, proxy compiled |
| Browser | dev server, Chrome | `/`, `/express` (six industries, template iframes 200), `/process` render as before; `/dashboard/*` → `/login?next=…`; `/login` renders at 375px; `/api/health` responds |

Not verifiable locally: every `/dashboard` and `/admin` page against real
rows, because no Supabase project exists (see risks). Their queries typecheck
against the generated schema and their policies are exercised in SQL.

## Security review (13 Sep 2026)

Findings and what was done:

1. **Cross-tenant references** — a member of A could insert a `domains` /
   `change_requests` row for A that pointed at B's `website_id`; RLS checked
   only `organization_id`. Fixed with `vigil.enforce_same_org_references()` on
   websites, domains, subscriptions, usage_records, provisioning_jobs,
   change_requests, leads. Covered by three new RLS assertions.
2. **Staff and customers share the `authenticated` role**, so column-level
   GRANTs cannot separate them. Replaced with
   `vigil.protect_columns_from_customers(...)` triggers on profiles (email),
   organizations (slug/status/notes), notifications, change_requests
   (assignment/allowance), leads (contact data). Tested.
3. **Audit noise** — job status hops were being audited; removed so customer
   activity stays meaningful. Jobs keep their own timestamps/errors.
4. **Job runner secret** compared with `timingSafeEqual`.
5. **Sign-out route** rejects cross-site POSTs (Origin / Sec-Fetch-Site).
6. **Job idempotency for manual re-queues** bucketed to the minute so a
   double click cannot queue two deploys.
7. **Post-login redirect** only accepts same-origin paths; tested against
   absolute, protocol-relative, backslash and header-injection forms.
8. **Provider ids, webhook payloads, job internals, staff table** are
   unreadable to customers (RLS; tested).
9. **`audit_events`** has no insert policy; rows enter only through the
   definer function, which refuses organizations the caller cannot see.

Reviewed and accepted as-is:

- `profiles` are visible to co-members of an organization (names and emails
  in the Team list). Staff see all profiles.
- A stranger can complete a magic-link sign-in and get a `profiles` row with
  no memberships; they see only the welcome screen.
- Two active subscriptions for one organization are possible by admin
  action; entitlements resolve to the highest tier. A uniqueness rule belongs
  with the billing phase.

## Unresolved risks and decisions

1. **No Supabase project.** `.env.local` still points at
   `fotqwyfoqzjmcchwjpof.supabase.co`, which no longer resolves. Nothing under
   `/dashboard` or `/admin` can be exercised until a project exists.
2. **Staff bootstrap** requires one row inserted with the service role (below).
3. **Express order → organization** bridge is not built; `projects.source_ref`
   is reserved for the leadgen order reference.
4. **Deployment topology, domain provider, pricing, allowances, offboarding**:
   configurable placeholders per master architecture §15.
5. **Next 16 `forbidden()`/`unauthorized()`** are experimental; the DAL
   redirects instead. One switch to flip later.
6. **RLS helper cost** at scale: policies call `vigil.is_org_member(org_id)`
   per row (indexed lookup). Fine for hundreds of tenants; revisit with
   `org_id in (select …)` if list queries slow down.
7. **Email template.** The default Supabase magic-link template uses the PKCE
   flow (`/auth/callback`). For links that work in any browser, switch the
   template to `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email`.

---

## Bringing it up (owner steps)

1. Create a Supabase project. Put its URL, publishable key and secret key in
   `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
   `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`). Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in production.
2. Apply the migrations:
   ```bash
   npx supabase@latest init && npx supabase@latest link --project-ref <ref> && npx supabase@latest db push
   ```
   (or paste the six files into the SQL editor in order).
3. Add the site URL and `/auth/callback`, `/auth/confirm` to Auth → URL
   Configuration → Redirect URLs.
4. Sign in once at `/login` with your own email, then in the SQL editor:
   ```sql
   insert into public.staff_members (user_id, role)
   select id, 'admin' from public.profiles where email = 'you@vigilstudios.co';
   ```
5. Open `/admin`, create the first customer, invite its owner.
6. Schedule `GET /api/jobs/run` with `Authorization: Bearer $VIGIL_JOBS_SECRET`
   (Vercel Cron or any scheduler; every 1–5 minutes on a paid plan, daily on
   Hobby). With the `null` providers the queue drains harmlessly.
7. Regenerate types after any migration:
   `npx supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema public --schema vigil > types/database.types.ts`.

## Next phase

Per master architecture §13, after locking the product catalog:

1. **Stripe adapter** — `StripeBillingProvider` implementing `BillingProvider`;
   `/api/webhooks/stripe` writing to `webhook_events` and calling
   `applySubscriptionSnapshot`; customer portal link on `/dashboard/billing`.
2. **Vercel adapter** — `VercelDeploymentProvider`; decide dedicated vs shared
   topology and record it in `websites.hosting_mode`.
3. **Domain flows** — Cloudflare adapter for Flow A; the guided Flow B already
   records the domain and DNS instructions.
4. **Express order bridge** — leadgen `orders` → organization + project +
   website, keyed on `projects.source_ref`.
5. **Requests allowances** — `usage_records` against
   `requests.monthly_allowance` once the numbers are approved.
